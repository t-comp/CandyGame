Candy Game or the name of the assignment "CandyRealm" is a twist on Candy Land and my first attempt at a logic based game project. This assignment was the final programming assignment in COMS127 - Introduction to Programming where I utilized the Turtle Module in Python to move my characters, draw cards, and other feautures of the game. I wanted to add characters in the game that the Turtle Module did not have so I created them on Canva, as well as the board. The module can only have graphics that are gifs, so I have to make use of converters online. I gained several handy pieces of knowledge, rather than just programming skills while creating this. I had not composed such a project before, as my first project was in HTML and CSS, so this one was a bit more difficult to implement with more creative freedom than past assignments in this class. However, I found it was a great starting point for creating personal projects in the future and it gave me a hint of a glimpse of what I could accomplish with programming. While I can say my projects and knowledge have become a _bit_ more advanced since the start of my computer science journey, Candy Game will always be the start of what I have and can accomplish.
